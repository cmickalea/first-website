	<span><p class="ns"> Other than gender, name is the first form of identity given when we first enter the world. Every name has a story, a meaning, an emotion attached. My first assignment when I started graphic design was to create a design around my name. I chose my nickname and made two creations. Both have a character-like element and a vibrancy but where the first one is expansive, detailed, structured yet imperfect with it's assymmetry, the second design is tame, simple even though it's accents say "bam!". The inability to represent my name, my identity in one design is just a manifestion of my inability to ever be one thing, it represents my duality.</p></span>
